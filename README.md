showcase-try-on
===============

Showcase that lets you upload pictures to a canvas and drop images on it from a carousel containing a predefined set of images.
The result can be posted to Facebook.

These dropped images can be re sized, translated and/or rotated.
You can see a working example at http://www.maskfrance.com/#!maskon/c6o8

This example pretty much put together <a href="https://github.com/codrops/Elastislide">Elastislide</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/">Fabric.js</a> and an integration of the Facebook API to publish the result to FB. A big thank you to all the contributors of Elastislide and Fabric.js for the amazing work they did and for allowing people to freely benefit from it.
