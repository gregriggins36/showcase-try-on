showcase-try-on
===============

Showcase that lets you upload pictures to a canvas and drop images on it from a carousel containing a predefined set of images.
The result can be posted to Facebook.

These dropped images can be re sized, translated and/or rotated.
You can see a working example at http://www.maskfrance.com/#!maskon/c6o8

! Please note that for the Facebook upload to work I had to create a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com">Facebook application</a> and set it up to the website maskfrance.com please see the following <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/web/tutorials/scrumptious/register-facebook-application">documentation</a>. I also had to go through a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/submission-process">Facebook submission</a> to be able to request publish_actions from the users of my application. 

This example pretty much put together <a href="https://github.com/codrops/Elastislide">Elastislide</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/">Fabric.js</a> and an integration of the Facebook API to publish the result to FB. A big thank you to all the contributors of Elastislide and Fabric.js for the amazing work they did and for allowing people to freely benefit from it.
